# Breaking Bricks Game

Breaking Bricks is a classic arcade-style game in which the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball upward and break a wall of bricks. The objective is to clear all bricks while preventing the ball from falling past the paddle.

## Features
- Player-controlled paddle movement
- Real-time ball movement and collision detection
- Brick breaking mechanics
- Game loop implementation with win/loss conditions
- State management for gameplay flow

## Technical Overview
This project focuses on implementing core game development concepts, including:
- Event handling for player input
- Collision detection between the ball, paddle, walls, and bricks
- Game loop design and state management
- Object-oriented programming principles

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Event Handling
- Collision Detection

## What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of game logic, control flow, and real-time state management. I also gained experience designing structured code and debugging interactive applications.
